# pinterest-semantic-field
Personal, read-only toolkit to turn my Pinterest boards/sections into structured insight. Uses the official API v5 to fetch my pins (metadata + image URLs), then builds a semantic field: hashtags, co-occurrence, key terms, and color palettes. Exports CSV + an HTML report. Scripts for API pulls and per-section analysis. ToS-compliant and local-first
