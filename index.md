# Pinterest Semantic Field (Personal App)

This is a personal, read-only tool I use to analyze my own Pinterest boards and sections.
It uses the official Pinterest API v5 to fetch board and pin metadata that I own or collaborate on,
and then computes semantic summaries (hashtags, co-occurrences, and palettes).

**Status:** Personal use only. No commercial users.  
**Data scopes requested:** boards:read, boards:read_secret, pins:read, pins:read_secret, user_accounts:read  
**What it does NOT do:** no posting, no editing, no ads, no third-party sharing.
