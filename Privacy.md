# Privacy Policy — Pinterest Semantic Field (Personal App)

**Effective date:** 28/09/25

## Who is behind this
This is a personal project operated by <Martin Hyggelig/hyggyprograma@gmail.com>. It is not a company product.

## What data I access
Only via Pinterest’s official API v5 and only after my own authorization:
- Board and pin metadata for boards I own or where my account is a collaborator
  (e.g., board/section IDs, pin IDs/URLs, titles, descriptions, alt text, timestamps, media URLs).
- No write actions are performed.

## How I use the data
- To generate personal semantic reports (hashtags, co-occurrence, color summaries).
- For personal research/organization only.

## Where data is stored
- Locally on my own devices. No server-side database. No cloud sync by this app.
- If images are downloaded, they are stored locally for palette extraction.

## Sharing and selling
- No data is shared, sold, rented, or disclosed to third parties.

## Retention
- I retain data only as long as I need it for personal analysis; I can delete it at any time.

## Security
- The access token is stored locally for my own use. I rotate/delete it if compromised.

## Your choices
- Since this is a personal app used only on my account, there are no external users.
  If you believe your content appears here and wish to raise a concern, contact me.

## Changes
- I may update this policy. The latest version will always be at this URL.
